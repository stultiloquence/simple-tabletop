# simple-tabletop

Right now this is work in progress.

A super simple virtual tabletop that does nothing but display tokens on a map that certain users have the rigth to move. It supports simple walls, doors, and field of view, and measuring distance.

This project is strongly opinionated in its minimalism, possibly so much so that only I will ever use it. In contrast to more fully-featured alternatives like <https://foundryvtt.com/>, <https://roll20.net/> or <https://astraltabletop.net>, it does not have any of the following:

- No video calls, voice chat or even chat—there are plenty of programs for that.
- No support for character sheets—I like to use <https://dndbeyond.com>.
- Not even support for displaying rolls—<https://dndbeyond.com> has a feature that does that.
- No support for playing sounds or music—I like to use a discord bot instead.
- No journals for taking notes—there are so many alternatives.
- No marketplace or surrounding social network.
- No scripting—to me it feels like trying to emulate aspects of computer games (which is of course perfectly fine and can probably be really awesome! Just not what I am personally looking for.)
